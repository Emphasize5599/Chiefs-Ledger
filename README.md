A command-line toolset that any Chief can use to keep track of the most seasoned Clash of Clans players.

These tools, while rudimentary, can be used together to be your own personal player activity Ledger.

The C++ program sequences any continuous range of player tags using reverse-engineered methods, outputs the tag files to a specified directory, and also features some rudimentary menu navigation capabilities.

The Python programs take the tag files, uses the coc.py Clash of Clans API wrapper to query for player and clan data, and constructs CSV file databases. 

These databases can be easily sorted through with a spreadsheet program like LibreOffice Calc or Excel, and the data is pretty interesting depending on your tag range.

While these programs are awaiting a rewrite (probably in C++ since I like it more), you can definitely still have fun and learn from them, whether you're interested in the databases or the sequencing methods found in the code :)
